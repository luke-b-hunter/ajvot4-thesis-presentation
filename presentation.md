For my thesis project I decided to create a visual style for my own made up frivolous political party. Political satire has it’s own history, that hasn’t been examined properly and because of it’s small effectiveness amd influence in politics, it has mostly remained forgotten in our society. And so a majority of people can barely remember any frivolous parties, despite there being already a few throughout political history. There is a tradition of humorouss way of seeing life, that is deeply engraved in Czech mentality, starting with the Czech writer Jaroslav Hasek and so it makes sense to continue with that tradition in my thesis project.Let's take a look at other satirical parties in Czech Republic and analyze their logos.

# Brief Analysis of Czech Satirical Partie's logos: 

# *The Party of Moderate Progress Within the Bounds of the Law* 

The Party of Moderate Progress Within the Bounds of the Law was a Czech satirical party made by the famous Czech writer Jaroslav Hasek. The party used a playful font that was applied to promotional flyers. The party mostly toyed with banners, most of which contained various satirical slogans, and made fun of the rhetoric of the politicians of that time. The party's logo is not known and it is believed that the party did not use any, as logos did not play a crucial role at that time. Hasek mostly focused on the content rather than from the visual side and wrote his own speeches, describing the party's activities, which he then read to his bohemian community in a humorous way.

# *Friends of Beer Party*

The Friends of Beer party used a stylized beer for their logo. It is a classic use of symbols that reflect the 1990s. The abbreviation of the party formed the symbol of a beer glass. It is an interesting combination of symbol and letters in one symbol. The party used relatively simple leaflets with a collage of beer, which in today's context seem rather outdated. The site has its own website, which looks a bit outdated, but from a brief informative page, we will learn everything we need to know about the party.

# *Balbín's Poetic Party*

The party's logo is based mainly on the logo of Balbín's poetic pub which serves as a sort of headquarters for the party. The color of the logo is neutral black and this color is also used on official promotional items, such as a T-shirt worn by the party's chairman or a flag used for events on Wenceslas Square. The logo is playful and presents to the audience the local character of the party. It does not act seriously and at the same time characterizes the party as an anti-system movement. The main uniform element is a bowler hat, which appears on both the logo and the chairman's costume and was also used on their banners. The bowler hat became part of the party's identity itself. The party used collages of politicians from serious parties with provocative headlines as their billboards.

# My own satirical party #

I created my own party that uses the technique of shock marketing to gain attention and fame through media. The party has it's own platform made up of twelve performances for each street that is named after a world country. Ambitions of the made up party aren't to get into local politics but to reflect on local problems of Prague, such as cars parked on sidewalks, shortage of living, loud drunktards etc. The aim is to bring attention to these problems through various satirical marketing performances that will happen on the streets of Prague 10 Vrsovice. The reason why I chose this part of Prague is because it's a part of Prague I grew up in and know well and it's a place that has the most streets that bare the name after world countries. Country street names are crucial to my party because it's satirical aim is to create "Peace in the world" through these various guerilla performances happening on the streets. 


# *Logo*

The logo is made up of the party's name and would be in a neutral black colour so it can distinguish itself from other movement and party logo's in the Czech Republic. The logo includes an exclamation mark, that symbolizes something radical, crazy and unusual. The exclamation mark can also be used as it's own standalone symbol that is mainly used as an avatar icon. The logo's colour would change in accordance to the colour of the visuals to reflect a more humorous, satirical and sympathetic style. The logo is made up of the party's name. The party's name is "Uličníci" which can be roughly translated to "Rascals". "Ulice" in Czech can also be translated to "streets". The name has a double meaning in itself that reflects on streets and rascals. 

# *The Movement's Platform*

Each performance in the platform is represented by a point. Each point in the official platform has a satirical problem that is accompanied with a real solution. Each point in the platform is presented as nonsense but it actually represents an actial local problem of Prague. The party's name is "Uličníci" which can be roughly translated to "Rascals". "Ulice" in Czech can also translated to "streets". The name has a double meaning in itself. The party has it's own logo and other various promotional materials such as an umbrella or a poster. The umbrella would be used for various humorous performances. The party describes itself as a satirical movement that isn't meant to be taken seriously.
