# My Thesis #

For my thesis project I decided to create a visual style for my own made up frivolous political party. Political satire has it’s own history, that hasn’t been examined properly and because of it’s small effectiveness amd influence in politics, it has mostly remained forgotten in our society. And so a majority of people can barely remember any frivolous parties, despite there being already a few throughout political history. There is a tradition of humorouss way of seeing life, that is deeply engraved in Czech mentality, starting with the Czech writer Jaroslav Hasek and so it makes sense to continue with that tradition in my thesis project.Let's take a look at other satirical parties in Czech Republic and analyze their logos.

# Brief Analysis of Czech Satirical Partie's logos: 

# *The Party of Moderate Progress Within the Bounds of the Law* 

The Party of Moderate Progress Within the Bounds of the Law was a Czech satirical party made by the famous Czech writer Jaroslav Hasek. The party used a playful font that was applied to promotional flyers. The party mostly toyed with banners, most of which contained various satirical slogans, and made fun of the rhetoric of the politicians of that time. The party's logo is not known and it is believed that the party did not use any, as logos did not play a crucial role at that time. Hasek mostly focused on the content rather than from the visual side and wrote his own speeches, describing the party's activities, which he then read to his bohemian community in a humorous way.

# *Friends of Beer Party*

The Friends of Beer party used a stylized beer for their logo. It is a classic use of symbols that reflect the 1990s. The abbreviation of the party formed the symbol of a beer glass. It is an interesting combination of symbol and letters in one symbol. The party used relatively simple leaflets with a collage of beer, which in today's context seem rather outdated. The site has its own website, which looks a bit outdated, but from a brief informative page, we will learn everything we need to know about the party.

# *Balbín's Poetic Party*

The party's logo is based mainly on the logo of Balbín's poetic pub which serves as a sort of headquarters for the party. The color of the logo is neutral black and this color is also used on official promotional items, such as a T-shirt worn by the party's chairman or a flag used for events on Wenceslas Square. The logo is playful and presents to the audience the local character of the party. It does not act seriously and at the same time characterizes the party as an anti-system movement. The main uniform element is a bowler hat, which appears on both the logo and the chairman's costume and was also used on their banners. The bowler hat became part of the party's identity itself. The party used collages of politicians from serious parties with provocative headlines as their billboards. 

# My own satirical party #

I created my own party that uses the technique of shock marketing to gain attention and fame through media. The party has it's own platform made up of twelve performances for each street that is named after a world country. Ambitions of the made up party aren't to get into local politics but to reflect on local problems of Prague, such as cars parked on sidewalks, shortage of living, loud drunktards etc. The aim is to bring attention to these problems through various satirical marketing performances that will happen on the streets of Prague 10 Vrsovice. The reason why I chose this part of Prague is because it's a part of Prague I grew up in and know well and it's a place that has the most streets that bare the name after world countries. Country street names are crucial to my party because it's satirical aim is to create "Peace in the world" through these various guerilla performances happening on the streets. At the end of each performance would be a flag raising ceremony that would mark the end of each performance. 

# *Visual style*

The visual style is made up of logo, posters, brochures and other promotional materials, that are used to promote each performance of the party. 

# *Logo*

The logo is made up of the party's name and would be in a neutral black colour so it can distinguish itself from other movement and party logo's in the Czech Republic. The logo includes an exclamation mark, that symbolizes something radical, crazy and unusual. The exclamation mark can also be used as it's own standalone symbol that is mainly used as an avatar icon. The logo's colour would change in accordance to the colour of the visuals to reflect a more humorous, satirical and sympathetic style. The logo is made up of the party's name. The party's name is "Uličníci" which can be roughly translated to "Rascals". "Ulice" in Czech can also be translated to "streets". The name has a double meaning in itself that reflects on streets and rascals. 

# *The Movement's Platform*

Each performance in the platform is represented by a point. Each point in the official platform has a satirical undertone that is accompanied with a real solution. What we can in the party brochure is presented as satirical nonsense but it actually reflects on real local problems of Prague. The party uses it's logo on the front side of the brochure. The brochure works as a progress bar where each performance that already took place is marked with a photo. 

# *Facebook page*

On the Facebook page, you can see a cover photo using the logo and a group of performers. The group of performers is used to reflect on the fact that party is a small local movement and not a big serious party. You can see the exclamation mark used as an official avatar. The Facebook page would be used as an place to promote the performance and the problem the individual performance is adressing. After the end of each performance a post would be made to mark the end of each performance.

# *Performance for Slovenian street*

The performance for Slovenian street is reflecting on the problem of living and it's expensive costs. It pokes fun at the name similarities between Slovenia and Slovakia. It satirizes the constant fun poking between Czechs and Slovaks and in the spirit of satire the name of the perfomance would be Slovexit. The event also parodies the constant confusion between the names of the countries of Slovenia and Slovakia. The whole event is completely carried in an ironic spirit, both in its style, dialogue and its goals. The satirical goal is to expel Slovaks from Slovinská Street so that the space for living can be freed up. The event could be played by theater actors other hired actors or other volunteers. The performance would be be accompanied with a banner that would explain the local problem the performance is reflecting on.

# *Visuals for Slovenian street*

The visuals are made with two styles. The first is a pictogramic style where the pictograms symbolize Slovaks in a stereotypical way. The pictograms also symbolize the same pictograms that can be found on exit signs. This whole style is inspired by pictograms of people that you can find on various street signs. The pictogramic style would be informative since the movement is trying to introduce itself and it's intentions to the public. The second style is a humorous collage of various people and objects that symbolize the performance. The collage style would be used mainly for promotional brochures that would promote the performance. Each visuals would use the colours of the country's flag the street is named after. In the case for Slovenian street it is red, white and blue. 

# *Guerilla promotion*

Another guerilla promotion could be used for the promotion of the performance, where the pictogram from the visual could be used as a standalone symbol on walls that could be easily reproduced throughout the district and street. 

# *Online posts*

Online posts form an online strategy that would first promote the point in the platform and than explain the local problem behind it. The posts would use a formal style and a humorous collage style to add in the frivolous aspect. The collage styled posts use a humorous poetic style of talking. At the end of the performance a post promoting the flag raising ceremony would show up on the feed. A similar system would be used for Instagram where photos of the performance would be added after the end of it.

# *Merchandising for Slovenian street*

After the performance, the audience would be encouraged to take a promotional material made up of a badge and a t-shirt. The promotional materials are used to help promote the movement and make it more famous. The badge would use a pictogram the same way the visual uses the symbol. The t-shirt would be made up of exclamation marks on the front side and a statement on the back side that says "We (Rascals) were in Slovenian street." The badge is made up of a pictogram that you can find on the visual. 

# *The Flag Raising Ceremony*

The event would take place in the same street as the previous primary event and could be joined by anyone. It is rather a secondary event and from a marketing point of view, it is not as important to the movement as the primary event. The flag could be raised on any object that would serve as a flag pole. The flag would be made up of an exclamation point and the same pictogram that you can find on the visual and on the badge. 

# *Performance for Kazakh street*

This performance is would take place in the same spirit as in Slovenian Street and would again use a satirical dialogue with the public. The event would be called " A Competition for Power." This time there would be a satirical performance, where the actors would organize a special competition to choose the chief administrator of the housing units in Kazakh Street after who's name will then the street's whole name be changed. The event is inspired by the renaming of the capital of Kazakhstan, which was named after the name of the former president of that country. The competition would select one actor. This actor would play a chosen leader who would force out a sheep model with wheels out of the street that symbolizes a car. The actor would have a typical Kazakh hat on his head. In an authoritative tone, the actor would then urge the sheep model to be taken out of the street and the street renamed after the his name. The consequence of such an intervention will be the relocation of residents and with it, the disappearance of cars from the street. This event aims to draw attention to the issue of illegal parking in the streets of Vršovice. This is a satirical exaggeration which only wants to draw attention to the issue of illegal parking in the Prague district. 

# *Visuals for Kazakh street*

The visual uses a colour combination of blue and yellow, derrived from the Kazakh flag. On the visual we can find a pictogram of a stylized Kazakh with a Kazakh hat, which oversees the sheep depicted in the style of a car. The visual uses a different dimension of the pictogram so that the visual style does not seem too monotonous. However, the dimensions and format of the title and text are preserved so that associations with the movement can be easily identified. A brochure with a collage showing a model of a sheep on wheels would be used as a supplementary visual for outdoor communication. The Brochue contains similar colors with the same texts as the main visual. The texts on the leaflet are larger in size for better readability, as the leaflet would be in a smaller scale than the visual. The visual serves as an invitation to the event and, like the previous visual for Slovenian street, is intended to provoke shock in the public mind. 

# *Guerilla promotion*

The same guerilla promotion could be used for Kazakh street as for Slovenian street, where the pictogram is used as a symbol reproduced on the streets. 

# *Online posts*

The posts use a similar style and system of color as the posts for Slovenian street, where we can see formal posts and humorous posts being used. 

# *Merchandising for Kazakh street*

Materials for Kazakh street are created in the same style as for Slovenian street. They would be distributed to participants directly at the end of the performance. Participants would then promote the event through t-shirts with the movement's logo on the back and the words "We were in Kazakh street" on the back side. Promotional items could also be distributed during the event. 

# *The Flag Raising Ceremony*

The flag for Kazakh street could be raised on a pole in a street park. The street has enough space to organize such event. The flag would be based on the colors of the poster,  blue and yellow. A stylized Kazakh pictogram with the sheep would appear on the flag's surface with a yellow exclamation mark. 

# *Visuals for later performances*

The same system for Slovenian and Kazakh street would be used for Armenian and Turkmen streets. An event called Vardavar would take place for Armenian Street, which is derrived from a traditional Armenian festival where people pour buckets of water on each others heads. Actors would pour buckets of water on other performers who represent drunktards and scare them off the street. The aim of the event is to expel the disturbers so that the inhabitants can sleep in peace at night. The visuals would be drawn in the colors of the Armenian flag. Since these performances would take place after a certain period of time from the first two events, the movement would reach higher media awareness and so the visuals would be simplified to one big exclamation mark. The color is red-blue-orange. Similarly, the exclamation symbol would be used on a poster for Turkmen street in the colors of the Turkmen flag which are red white and green. For Turkmen street, a puppet theater could be created based on the topic of liberating the street from autocratic apartment owners. The brochures would contain a collage just like the previous ones, but they would no longer be using an informational style for the reason of deliberate stylization. On the contrary, the logo of the movement would be significant. this is underlined by the fact that the public will already know the movement better, and therefore can afford to use easier communication in their visuals.
